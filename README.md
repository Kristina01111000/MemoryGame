# MemoryGame
Basic memory game using javascript


8 images needed, 100 by 100 px, they are stored in the first issue -> changed the pictures to something better on computer, these are just standins

to do:

- make game reset button work
  - move it all into start game function?
  - check that the click is being caught, it may not be firing the reset
- add timer
  - need to figure out how to use 2 intervals at the same time or some other work around,
    - otherwise the second piece flips too quickly to see when clicked, so the game can't be played
-  set all of the game start code into a start function --> will fix reset button problem
