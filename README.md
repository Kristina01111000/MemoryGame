# MemoryGame
Basic memory game using javascript

- figure out how to update from atom

8 images needed, 100 by 100 px, they are stored in the first issue -> change the pictures to something better later

to do:

- make game reset button work
- add timer
  - need to figure out how to use 2 intervals at the same time, otherwise the second piece flips too quickly to see when clicked
- fix the shuffle method, its not good
  - fisher yates shuffle method not allowing game board to load, figure it out later
