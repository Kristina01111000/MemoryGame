# MemoryGame
Basic memory game using javascript


8 images needed, 100 by 100 px, they are stored in the first issue -> changed the pictures to something better on computer, these are just standins

to add/do later:

- make game reset button work
  - move it all into start game function?
- add timer
  - need to figure out how to use 2 intervals at the same time, otherwise the second piece flips too quickly to see when clicked
